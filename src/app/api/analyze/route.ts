RULES FOR WEATHER-AWARE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Tailor water, fertilizer, and general diagnostic suggestions based on this weather context.
- For example, if rain probability is high (e.g. above 50% or current condition is rainy), strongly suggest reducing or pausing irrigation.
- If the temperature is very high or conditions are very dry, recommend protective watering.
- If humidity is high and there is a fungal disease, warn about poor air circulation.

Rules:
- Estimate overall health and specify if any disease is visible.
- If no disease is detected, output "No visible disease" for disease and "None" for severity.
- In cause, explain what pathogen, fungus, bacteria, virus, insect, or deficiency caused the disease.
- In whyOccurs, explain why the disease develops (e.g., poor ventilation, humidity, overwatering, deficient nutrients).
- In symptoms, return an array of strings outlining leaf/stem visual symptoms.
- In treatment, return an array of strings detailing step-by-step remedial treatments (organic or chemical).
- In prevention, return an array of strings detailing preventative actions.
- In recoveryTime, estimate the recovery period (e.g. "7-14 days").
- In confidenceReason, provide an array of strings explaining why the confidence score is high or low (e.g. image quality, leaf visibility, camera focus, lighting).
- In imageQuality, assess the uploaded image quality (e.g. "Good", "Fair", "Poor").
- In analysisLimitations, list any limitations of the visual analysis (e.g. "Blurry image", "Leaf partially covered", or "No major limitations detected").
- In analysisSummary, write a short paragraph summarizing the diagnosis.
- No markdown formatting.
- No explanation.
- JSON only.
